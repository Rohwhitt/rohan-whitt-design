            <p>
              This project started as a challenge to come up with a futuristic
              product idea based on new and upcoming technologies. Out of the
              all the ideas, my concept was voted second best. Groups were then
              formed for the top 4 ideas, and my concept was refined with the
              help of my team members.<br /><br />
              The concept was a collar able to detect the feelings and actions
              of dogs, allowing owners to monitor their pets more accurately
              while away from home. We decided to design an app based off the
              research done on device usage for our target audience.

            <h5>Design</h5>
            <h2>Minimalistic Design</h2>
            <p>
              When designing the app, it had to be a simple interface with
              minimal visual noise. The app displays most of the information as
              infographics, making it far easier for users to quickly gauge
              progress and other statistics. Colours are also used to highlight
              progress and status, making it easier to view the important
              info.<br /><br />
              Text was kept to a minimal, as we knew users wouldn’t want to read
              through large amounts of text when checking on their pet. Symbols
              were also used where possible to reduce clutter. Lastly, there was
              a focus on creating a logical hierarchy of information, displaying
              the most essential information such as profile and health status
              first.

            <h2>Included Features</h2>
            <p>
              The first feature that had to be included was a general overview
              of the pet’s health. We made sure users were able to add multiple
              pets and get an overview of each one when clicked on. A more
              specific overview was also included to show health statistics such
              as any diseases or deficiencies. Location was also an integral
              part of the app, as it allowed owners to track their pets and set
              a lost status.<br /><br />
              A timeline was also included so owners can see the actions of
              their pets throughout the day, as well as their actions through
              the app. This timeline also includes how certain actions affected
              the mood of their pets. Lastly, a virtual pat and speak features
              were included as part of the collar and app. Every feature in the
              app was designed to work with the current and future technology,
              researched in this project.
